# HamburgerToppings

This project manages and analyzes data from a survey that asked participants to select the toppings they would like on their ideal hamburger.

The survey can be found [here][https://forms.gle/RXSQARzXiWD3V9zk8].

The survey was built and distributed using Google Survey. Each ingredient was listed with a checkbox next to it. In addition, there was an 'other' option for ingredients that were not listed in the original survey. 

The CSV file produced by Google Survey is included in this directory. The python  file, HamburgerCSVtoARFF.py, converts the CSV file to a more organized ARFF file, which has also been included in this directory.
